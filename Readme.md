## Gaminator
Gaminator is an attempt at simulating/making a game with c++ wherein the users can write their algorithm to run their player in an attempt to beat the already written bot in the game.

The idea is to have a simulation environment that allows people to write and submit their hero's code and run it against the bot(?) or maybe even other people to compete against them. Currently the game(?) is under development.
